This repository contains some steps and files required for the WOSR workshop on AI Agents with Nishi Ajmera.

Make sure you activate you free google credits from the QR code in the presentation. You may need to activate a billing account in a GCP project in order to make use of these credits. This will require card details, however you will not be charged for anything. After the workshop you will be able to delete any GCP resources which you created, so you will not be charged.

Please find details steps for the lab here: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/building-ai-agents-vertexai#1 

Please use the YAML definition in the dummy_posts.yaml to play around with the tooling of the AI Agent that you create.
